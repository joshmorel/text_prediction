Background
========================================================

Text prediction has become ubiquitous with the use of mobile phones and the text messaging service.

This is my own take on text prediction utilizing the stupid-backoff algorithm.

Algorithm - Stupid Backoff
========================================================

Add formula here:

This particular app uses the Stupid Backoff algorithm for text prediction. This algorithm is described here:

This algorithm has a huge advantage over other, more fancy algorithms. That is, it can be used to process a large amount of data, instead of needing to sample and throw out a lot of potentially value data.

The App Itself
========================================================

Put a picture here with the app, and also the link

What's Next?
========================================================

With more tuning, this app could be made better, unfortunatley more time spent comparing different variables. More time
spent comparing vs other models to verify it's value, using different algorithms. Something.
